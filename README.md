# Introduction

This is the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional certificate program on Coursera. In this project, I will be applying many of the concepts that I have learned throughout the entire curriculum in order to complete a start to end data science project.

The premise of the project is this: I am working at a startup called Space Y, which is a competitor in the commercial space market. Our largest competitor is the familiar Space X, led by Elon Musk. One of the main reasons for Space X's success is the relative cheapness of their Falcon 9 rocket launches. The advertised price for a launch with their Falcon 9 rocket is approximately \\$67 million (as of December 2022). In comparison, other companies charge in the upper \\$100 millions.

One reason for the inexpensiveness of these launches is that the first stage of the rocket is reusable. The first stage is designed to be able to land itself on remote pads where the company can then recover it (see below). However, sometimes the first stage is not recovered. There are times when the first stage crashes or is sacrificed due to mission parameters like payload, orbit, or the customer's needs. If we can determine if the first stage in a particular Falcon 9 launch will successfully land and be recovered, we can estimate the total cost of a launch. This information will be invaluable for Space Y stakeholders.
